Should references be removed? They don't abstract much away and just end up making things more confusing. They take much of the work away from scoped-identifiers so that scoped-identifiers just end up being associated with references.

decision: move semantics of references into scoped-identifiers and get rid of references.


----- 1
expressions evaluate to values
scoped-identifiers are associated with zero or more values
a function scoped-identifier is associated with multiple values

func foo() Int ...
func foo(Int, Int) Rat ...
func foo(MyFace) ...

dyn bar = foo

func doStuff(obj a) //or
func doStuff(dyn a)
doStuff(foo)

(bind-each-func
	'maz
	(getFuncs))


----- 2
expressions evaluate to references
scoped-identifiers are associated with a single reference
a function scoped-identifier is associated with a single function reference

func foo() Int ...
func foo(Int, Int) Rat ...
func foo(MyFace) ...

dyn bar = (combine foo)

doStuff( (combine foo) )

func maz = getFuncs()
