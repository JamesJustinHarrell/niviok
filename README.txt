Other files may:
	* not have been updated in ages
	* be malformed
	* not make any sense

To translate the DocBook files into HTML, run genhtml.py

Desal 001 also contains abandoned, barely started, projects related to Funsynn. "other" mostly contains stuff that will eventually be put into specifications. The files in "specs/plain text" should eventually be turned into DocBook.
