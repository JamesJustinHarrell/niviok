operations for:
add
subtract
concatenate
join
split
insert
remove


We are dealing with:
	collections
	elements

With add and subtract, order does not matter. This includes things like integers, interfaces, and sets.

With concatenate and split, order matters. This includes things like strings and chains.

With collections, only the type of elements in the collection can be inserted and removed from the collection. For example, strings cannot be inserted into strings (although strings can be concatenated with strings).
