add option for processing mode to Desal Impl
	off
	warn
	normal (default)

in spec, split processing into 3 things
	checking scope/scoped-identifier tree
		define scope tree
	checking types (but not member access)
		assignments
		type of arguments to methods (also involves getting face of method)
	checking member access
		property set/get
		method call
		calling values (callees)
	node-specific processing stuff

spec times that libraries can be imported (import nodes handled)
	* before processing
	* between processing
	* during runtime (after processing)
example 1:
	import static libraries (before processing)
	compile to machine code (processing)
	save machine code
	open machine code
	import dynamic libraries (between processing)
	check stuff again (processing)
example 2:
	import static libraries (before processing)
	compile to machine code (processing)
	save machine code
	open machine code
	import dynamic libraries (after processing)
	run code

how to check member access and shit
	ScopeFormula to produce scope tree
	Node_Expression.processRefCat()
		returns ReferenceCategory (or null? would that ever be possible?)
	Node_Expression.processFace()
		returns IInterface or null if can't figure out
