Inside of a brace-block, how do you know when you encounter a tab-block?

block {
	for i from 0 to 100
		println i
		println " "
}

What is the above equivalent to?

block {
	for i from 0 to 100 {
		println i
		println " "
	}
}

block {
	for i from 0 to 100 {
		println i
	}
	println " "
}


Solutions:
* Remove one of the block syntaxes.
* Use an operator to specify that a tab-block follows. Python uses a colon for this. If this operator is not present, only a single expression would be consumed.
* Modify one or both of the block syntaxes so they are compatible.


Third option:

BraceBlock =
	"{" [ Expression { "," Expression } ] "}" .

TabBlock =
	INDENT_OPEN Expression { NEWLINE Expression } NEWLINE INDENT_CLOSE .

BraceTabBlock =
	"{" NEWLINE TabBlock "}" .

block { a(), b(), c() }

block {
	a()
	b()
	c()
}
