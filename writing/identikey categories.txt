declare-* nodes:
	declare-first
	declare-empty
	declare-assign

identikey categories:
	namespace
	variable
	constant
	functions

namespace
	always constant
	bound to a namespace, instead of a value like other nodes
	has it's own creation nodes (e.g. import, using)

variable
	value can change
	identikey is typed, so that all values assigned must be of that type
		by that type can be dyn
	does not do function merging
	if type is automatically determined, cannot be created with declare-empty
	examples
		decl foo
		decl ? foo
		decl Int foo
		decl Int ? foo
		decl foo = 123 //nullable type required by identikey is dyn
		decl ? foo = 123
		decl auto foo = 123 //nullable type required by identikey determined from value
		decl auto ? foo = 123
		decl Int foo = 123 //nullable type required by identikey is explicitly stated
		decl Int ? foo = 123

constant
	single value (so single type)
	cannot be created with declare-empty
	examples
		decl const foo = 123
		decl const ? foo = 123
		decl const Int foo = 123
		decl const Int ? foo = 123

function
	multiple values
		but all declared when identikey created
		after creation, values can't be changed
		each value of a different type
	assigning null still creates the identikey (if it wasn't already created), but doesn't bind the identikey to a value
	does function merging
	can only be creatd with declare-first nodes
		not declare-empty or declare-assign
	examples:
		declfirst func foo = func(Int a) { a * 2 * 3 }
		declfirst func foo = func(Int a, Int b) { a * b * 2 }
		declfirst func foo = func(Int a, b, c) { a * b * c }
		declfirst func func()Int foo = getSomeFunction()


The nullable-type associated with a constant or function identikey can be used to downcast the value before assigning, but otherwise should have no effect on program execution.
