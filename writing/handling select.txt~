The "type select" node performs an action based on the first interface that a certain object implements. It has a boolean property "require handling".

type-select ::=
	boolean require handling
	+ case
	? expression else

interface Node
	...

interface Text
	inherit Node
	...

interface Document
	inherit Node
	...

interface Element
	inherit Node
	...

typeselect getElement()
	case Text
		foo()
	case Document
		bar()

If the value returned by getElement() is not a Text or Document object, the typeselect node simply produces null.

But here:

typeselect require getElement()
	case Text
		foo()
	case Document
		bar()

An error exception would be thrown. (Thus an agent may warn before execution that this will happen, and even refuse to work with the Desal bundle.)


This also gives Desal better supported of algebraic data types, a.k.a. tagged unions.
