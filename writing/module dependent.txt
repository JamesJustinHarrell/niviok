In many languages, libraries behave differently depending on the machine, program, and/or thread calling into them. This is especially prevalent with standard libraries.

Examples:
* accessing hardware
* information about operating system
* standard streams (in, out, err)
* program arguments
* program result codes
* process ID
* current directory
* current running thread

C example:
	printf("text");

C++ example:
	std::cout << "text" << std::endl;

C# example:
	System.Environment.MachineName
	System.Console.WriteLine("text");
	System.Environment.GetCommandLineArgs()
	System.Environment.ExitCode = 1;
	System.Environment.CurrentDirectory
	System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(100);

Java example:
	System.out.println("text");
	java.lang.Thread.sleep(100);

Python
	sys.stdout.write("text\n")
	sys.argv
	os.chdir("..")
	os.getcwd()

Either these aren't shared libraries, or they're using some kind of crazy magic.

Related: How do libraries output to (and input from) the standard streams?

Perhaps new nodes that produce integers when executed.
e.g. "program-id" and "module-id"
Same if the module the node is in is acting as a program, but if the module is acting as a library, produces the module id of the program module that called into the library module.

Then libraries could take advantage of this to behave differently depending on which program called into the library. For example, println(Stringable) could use the program-id to find that program module's standard out stream.

There could also be a std:println(Int, Stringable) so that libraries could print to the standard streams of the calling program module.
e.g. std:println(programid, "Bad arguments to do_stuff(). Doing nothing.")

It might be better to use an object with hidden internal stuff, rather than an integer. That would prevent feeding random integers into stuff.
	std:println(123, "test")
	object prog = programobject
	std:println(prog, "test")

However, that might make it more difficult to make a dictionary of id -> something. So maybe it would be a good idea to define an interface that has an integer property. That still requires obtaining the non-integer object, but allows using the integer to do integer-friendly stuff.

interface ModuleID
	get Int value

When you have this figured out, may want to:
* remove bridge property of Scope
* remove Bridge instances
* change how the agent prints strings for a specific module
	scope.bridge.println("text")
	scope.evaluateIdentifier(new Identifier("println")).call(
		new Argument(null, Bridge.toClientString("text")))
	G.println(scope, "text")
