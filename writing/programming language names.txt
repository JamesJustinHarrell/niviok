1 syllable is too short (boo, perl)
3 syllables is too long (c++, ecmascript, php)

double characters suck (smaLLtalk, grOOvy, eiFFel)

	6-8 characters
	2 syllables
	no repeated characters

representations should not have names that are similar to the name of the semantics

things that need names:
	semantics (previously Desam)
		Niviok
	text representation favoring terseness (previously Dextr)
		Fujin (from Final Fantasy VIII, whose sentences often consist of a single word)
	text representation favoring clarity (previously Desexp)
		Ivan (EE-von, from Digimon Savers, who keeps saying out loud what he's thinking)
	XML representation (previously Desible)
		Desible
	visual representation (previously Desual)
		Mitsuka (for Mitsuka Yoshimine from DearS, who is very sexy and showy)
	proof-of-concept implementation (previously Desal Implementation 001 and Desal Agent 001)
		Acrid (because it's written in C#, and "acrid" can be a synonym for sharp)
