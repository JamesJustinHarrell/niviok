* determine every bundle that will be needed (self and libraries)

----- cyclical dependencies

--- library A

import B

decl a = B.b + 1


--- library B

import A

decl b = A.a + 1



----- shared libraries and I/O

--- library S

func doStuff()
	std:println("test")

--- library Alpha

import S

func main()
	S:doStuff()

--- library Beta

import S

func main()
	S:doStuff()


How is S going to print to the correct console?
