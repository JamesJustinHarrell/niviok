Unicode strings should not be handled on a character-by-character basis. That would produce bad sequences. For example, a combining character without a character to combine with. Reversing a string by reversing the characters in that string could cause combining characters to combine with the wrong characters.

A modern programming language should provide excellent Unicode support, and that includes built-in support for obtaining the smallest sized valid subsequences.

For example, imagine X is a combining character is this string:
ABCXDEFXG

When iterating over this string, an old crusty language my yield this:
A, B, C, X, D, E, F, X, G

But Desal should instead yield the smallest vaild subsquences:
A, B, CX, D, E, FX, G


func reverse(String s)
	decl rv = Chain<String>()
	for sub in s
		rv.addBack(sub)
	return join(rv, "")
	
reverse("ABCXDEFXG")
	-> "GFXEDCXBA"


This strengthens the argument that String types are not just sequences of characters. A String in Desal should always be valid and meaningful.


When obtaining characters (or code points), it should be explicit.

e.g. ("text" to Sequence<Char>)


If programmers want to work with individual characters, they should have to do it explicitly, and not expect the language to be junked up with shit that supports it.


Problem: String is now a collection of Strings. (Similar to in Python.) Should a MinString type be created? Then a String could be a collection of MinString. I'm not sure that's a good idea though.

Perhaps a String should not inherit Collection. Characters can be obtained by breeding a Sequence<Char> and substrings can be obtained with e.g. String.minsubs(), String.split(), or String.maxsplit().


Constructor: String(Sequence<Char>)
If the sequence is invalid in some way, an exception should be thrown.
