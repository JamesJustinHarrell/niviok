Currently, there is nothing to prevent this:


namespace Alpha
	def beta = 123

namespace Alpha
	def beta = 567


or this:


sieve
	def beta = 123

sieve
	def beta = 567


Furthermore, there is nothing in place for catching this.


This is probably something that should be done once during processing. As such, I shouldn't worry about this for now, since I haven't yet really started working on the processing stage. As Acrid moves more things into the one-time processing stage, I should make sure to get this into it though.
