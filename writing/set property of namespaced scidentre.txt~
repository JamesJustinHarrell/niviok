Is this currently possible?

Foo:Bar:zap.alpha = 123

Should I make it possible? I'll probably just end up with "setAlpha" functions if I don't allow it.

The IScope interface will probably need to be changed to allow this.

zomg you retard, of course it's possible. The set-property node takes a worker from an expression, and it doesn't care what kind of expression that is. I seemed to be thinking the set-property node was directed to a worker by an identifier. Like this:
set-property ::=
	identifier target
	identifier property name
	identifier value
But that's not how it really is.

Foo:Bar:zap.alpha = 123 is just
(set-property
	(namespaced-wo-scidentre
		Foo
		Bar
		zap)
	alpha
	123)
