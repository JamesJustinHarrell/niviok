current algorithm would allow this:

def Foo = interface[
	get Bar bar
]
def Bar = 123

That's because I don't check to see what the node type is for the values of the scidentres I'm using as finish dependencies. I should only count an identifier as a finish dependency if it is going to get its value from an interface node.

However, for functions this is not the case. It seems that functions and interfaces have different kinds of dependency issues.
