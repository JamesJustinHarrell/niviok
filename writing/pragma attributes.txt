Every node should be capable of having multiple "pragma attributes". These attributes speak to the Niviok agent.

One use of pragma attributes would be to direct the agent to not output certain warnings.

It was decided to create pragma attributes, instead of a pragma node, because a pragma node would be too restricted about where it could appear.

For example, if the pragma node was an expression that wrapped another expression, and specified information about that expression, it could not be used for nodes that weren't expressions.
