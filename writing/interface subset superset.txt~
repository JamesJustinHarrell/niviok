Interfaces in Desal come in two forms: superset interfaces and subset interfaces.

Superset interfaces are like interfaces found in other languages. The members associated with a superset interface are either defined directly by the interface or inherited from other interfaces.

If superset interface A inherits interfaces B and C, then:
an A is a B
an A is a C
a B may be an A, but that is not necessarily true
a C may be an A, but that is not necessarily true

The members associated with a subset interface all come from other interfaces. Every member associated with the interface must be present in of those subsetted interfaces.

If subset interface A subsets interfaces B and C, then:
a B is an A
a C is an A
an A may be a B, but that is not necessarily true
an A may be a C, but that is not necessarily true

However, it should be noted that interfaces are not sets. (XXX come up with better name?)

interface A
	inherit B
	inherit C
	prop ro String myNewStuff //overrides member of same name in B and C, or just defines new member

interface A
	subsetof B
	subsetof C
	prop ro String theirOldStuff //must be in B and C -- should work the same and have the same purpose

//contains no members -- can be used somewhat like a tagged union a.k.a. algebraic data type
interface A
	subsetof B
	subsetof C


Note: An interface cannot use both subsetof and inherit.
Note: Not declaring subsetof's or inherit's is an implicit inheritance of the Object interface.
Note: Need to do much more thinking and writing about this, like inheriting subset interfaces.

Interface is a subset interface of SupersetInterface and SubsetInterface.

interface Interface
	subsetof SupersetInterface

interface SupersetInterface
	Collection<Interface> inheritees
	Collection<Member> ownMembers

interface SubsetInterface
	Collection<Interface> sources
	Collection<Member> takenMembers
