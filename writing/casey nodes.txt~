I have some nodes which are extremely similar in nature.

---

conditional ::=
	* conditional-case
	expression else

conditional-case ::=
	expression test
	expression result

conditional
case i lt 0
	println "< zero"
case i lt 5
	println "< five, but >= zero"
case i lt 100
	println "[5, 100)"
else
	println ">= 100"

---

select ::=
	expression input value
	* select-case
	expression else

select-case ::=
	+ expression value
	expression result

select foo
case 123
	println "foo is 123"
case 456, 789
	println "foo is 456 or 789"
else
	println "foo isn't 123, 456, or 789"

---

match ::=
	expression input value
	? identifier name
	* match-case
	expression else

match-case ::=
	+ expression test type
	expression result

match foo2 <== foo
case Int
	println "foo is an Int"
	foo2.add(123)
case String
	println "foo is a String"
	foo2.concat("text")
else
	println "I don't know what foo is"

---

try ::=
	expression body
	? identifier name
	* try-case
	? expression success
	? expression finally

try-case ::=
	expression type
	? expression test
	expression result

When no matching [case], let exception continue up.

catch e <== doStuff()
case NullException
	println "whoops!"
	throw e
case SomeError if e.foo is "bar"
	println "I'll just stop this."
else
	println "I don't have a clue what this is."
	throw e
success
	println "No errors. ^_^"
finally
	println "all done with this node!"
