decl Int number = 3
if number == 3
	throw Error("blah")

If an agent can determine that the test of a conditional node (XXX and some others, like the test of iteration nodes) will always be true, the agent should emit a warning.

This is different from warning about unreachable code, because that would only warn if a test was always true in an if-else, not just a conditional node.

func doSomething(Int num) {
	if num == 3
		throw Error("blah")
}

doSomething(3)

If an agent can determine that:
	* a specific function will sometimes throw an error, but not always
	* a specific call to that function will result in an exception being thrown
The agent should emit a warning that the call will result in an exception being thrown.
