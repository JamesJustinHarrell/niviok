Parallel to supertype interfaces, subtype interfaces, and union interfaces, are concept interfaces. These are similar to C++'s "concept" feature or Haskell's type classes.

A concept declares members that must be implemented, like a supertype interface. However, the means by which a worker/object is determined to implement an interface is different. That is, any worker/object that implements members with the same name and type as the concept interface is determined to implement that interface. Also, any interface that includes all members declared by a concept interface is said to inherit that concept interface.

So workers/objects cannot actually declare that they implement a particular concept interface, although a worker node can declare it wants to implement a concept interface in order to get the agent to ensure that it does.

Perhaps there could also be an auto-concept identikey type that automatically creates a concept interface depending on how the identikey is used.

Example:

interface Alpha
	func addCaps(String) //e.g. cap & arg & cap
	prop String cap

interface Beta
	func appendSuffix(String) //e.g. arg & suffix
	prop String suffix

interface Gamma
	func addCaps(String) //e.g. aBc -> aBcAC
	func addLower(String) //e.g. aBc -> aBcb
	func toCaps(String) //e.g. -> aBc -> ABC
	func toLower(String) //e.g. -> aBc -> abc

concept Decorator
	func addCaps(String)
	func appendSuffix(String)

decl foo = object
	impl Alpha
		...
	impl Beta
		...

decl bar = object
	impl Beta
		...
	impl Gamma
		...

function testDecorator(Decorator d, String base)
	println( d.addCaps(base) )
	println( d.appendSuffix(base) )

testDecorator(foo)
testDecorator(bar)
