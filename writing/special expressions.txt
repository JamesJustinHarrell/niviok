special expressions

They can be executed, but they can't appear where an "expression" is required. None of the special expressions can produce.

declare-first
hidable
identikey-special-new
identikey-special-old
limit-old
module
namespace

Rationale: Some nodes can be executed, but should only appear in certain case when explicitly allowed.
