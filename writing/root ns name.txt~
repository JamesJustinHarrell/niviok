differences between normal namespaces and bundle/plane/assembly/package/global namespace:

* normal namespaces are enclosed inside of other namespaces
* bundle namespaces are not enclosed inside of other namespaces

* normal namespaces have names
* bundle namespaces do not have names

* normal namespaces rely on the enclosing namespace/scope to give it the necessary identikeys/libraries
* bundle namespaces declare which libraries they need


rejected names:

bundle, package
	imply multiple items bound together
	may be empty or only define a single thing
module, component
	imply they're part of something larger
	may be a standalone program
parcel
	too strong associated with real-life stuff to be a good metaphor
assembly
	used by .NET
	implies multiple things have been assembled together


Decision was to use "module" as that is sorta used by D, Python, and Ruby.
