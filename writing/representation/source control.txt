One big problem with visual and database programming language representations is their incompatibility with source control. For Mitsuka/NiviokDBFormat to catch on, very solid plans will be needed for how Niviok could be edited in Mitsuka and stored in a repository. The issue of source control actually makes NiviokDBFormat less useful, since source code is usually (or should usually be) stored in a repository.

possibility:
	When editing:
		text format in repository -> abstract format -> Mitsuka
	When saving:
		text -> abstract format -> standardized text format -> repository
	The code would still be stored using creeky old flat text files, like 99.99% of the other programming files out there. However, editing would be done using beatiful fresh new Mitsuka.
	
	pro: Use current tools. Mix well with other stuff.
	con: Version of source code stored in repository would differ from view version.

possibility:
	A repository made just for Niviok. It would record Niviok nodes instead of just text fragments. It would store information such as blame in the repository on a node-by-node basis. Mitsuka could be expanded to have ways of showing blame and modification date on a node-by-node basis. An HTML generator could even be created to show this beatiful Mitsuka blame on the web.
	
	pro: No more flat text! Very cohesive. Always view in the same format.
	con: Tons of work. Wouldn't work well (or at all) with anything besides Niviok source code.


There is precendence here. Smalltalk and some Lisps have dealt with similar problems. See comments here:

comment:
"Smalltalk systems have been generating 'diffs' between the system-supplied image and your own mods for what feels like centuries."
See if this includes good blame support.
