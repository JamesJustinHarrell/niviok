In Dextr, the question mark is used to denote nullable types. However, I want to allow question marks in identifiers. This means there must be a space between an identifier specifying an interface and the trailing question mark, which could cause bad problems when the space isn't present.

But, if I just restrict identifiers so that question marks can't begin the identifier, I can move the question marks denoting nullability to the front of identifiers. That would make the space not required, and would be easier to read and easier to write correctly.

declfunc doStuff( Int ? a )
	println(a)

declfunc doStuff( ?Int a )
	println(a)

decl Int ? a = getNumberMaybe()

decl ?Int a = getNumberMaybe()
