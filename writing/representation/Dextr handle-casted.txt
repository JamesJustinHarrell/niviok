common code pattern:

	decl Node node = getNode()
	
	if( node impls Element )
		println( "<" + (o as Element).tagName + "/>" )
	elif( o impls Text )
		handleText( (o as Text).textValue )
	else
		throw Error("unknown type")

Some languages handle this use case with Algebraic Data Types, ADT. But this is closed, and requires declaring a new types. Desal instead just provides a simplified syntax:

	selectface node
	case Element
		println( "<" + node.tagName + "/>" )
	case Text
		handleText( node.textValue )
	else
		throw Error("unknown type")

This node may be described as:

	select-interface ::=
		expression value
		* case-interface
		? expression else
	
	case-interface ::=
		+ expression interface
		expression result

If Desal were to gain Algebraic Data Types, this node could possibly be expaned to work well with them. (Need to see what kind of features ADT languages have.)

Possible text:
	When the [value] of a [select-interface] node is an instance of an ADT, implementations should try to ensure that all possible types are handled by the [select-interface] node. If not all types are handled, a warning should be emitted.
