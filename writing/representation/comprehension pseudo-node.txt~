comprehension ::=
	expression source collection
	identifier element name
	? expression test
	? expression output

The comprehension pseudo-node has the syntax:
	[(output) for (element name) in (source collection) if (test)]

which is translated to:
	generator
		for (element name) in (source collection)
			if (test)
				yield (output)

For example, this input:
	[2*x for x in L if x^2 > 3]

Is translated to this:
	generator
		for x in L
			if x^2 > 3
				yield 2*x
