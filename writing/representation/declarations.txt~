namespace, constant, variable, function

namespace
	using Foo:Bar:Baz
	expose Alpha
	namespace Beta
		...

constant
	const foo 123
	const ?Int foo 123
	first foo 123
	first ?Int foo 123

variable
	var foo 123
	var ?Int foo 123
	var auto foo getSomething()
	var ?auto foo getSomething()
	auto foo getSomething()
	?auto foo getSomething()
	
function
	func doStuff {...}
	func (Int, Int -> Int) doStuff getFunction()

Idea: Although I don't want the "=" in declarations to be required, I think it would be a good idea to allow them. So instead of requiring them (like other languages) or disallowing them (like I previously wanted to do), they would be optional.

e.g. these are equivalent:
	const foo 123
	const foo = 123

But then most people would probably continue to use them and ignore the shorter form.

For consistency reasons, the "var auto"/"var ?auto" form should probably be removed. But that makes me realize that having an optional "=" in declarations also breeds inconsistency. Perhaps optional things are bad.
