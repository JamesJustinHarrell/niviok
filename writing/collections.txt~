Collections I want available in Desal.
Set, Bag, Dict, and MultDict should come in mutable and immutable forms.

Sequence (immutable sequence)

Deck (deque, sequence)
	can insert/remove at beginning and end

Chain (linked list, sequence)
	can insert/remove at any position directly through API using iterators

Set

Bag (multiset)

Dict (dictionary, associative array)

MultDict (multi-dictionary)



in native namespace:
	Array
	decl Array<Int> foo1 = Array.empty<Int>(size=500)
	decl Array<Int> foo2 = Array.convert<Int>(collection=numbers)
	decl Array<Int> foo3 = Array<Int>(1, 2, 3, 789, 90000)
	foo[12] = 45
	foo[78] = 910
	println(foo[12])
