Loop nodes can catch Break and Continue signals.

for-each ::=
	expression iterable
	? expression type
	? identifier name
	? expression test
	expression body

repeat ::=
	expression body

while ::=
	expression test
	expression body

func $each { iterable, body |
	for i in iterable
		body i
}

func $each_apply { iterable, body |
	for i in iterable
		apply body i
}

func $repeat { body |
	repeat
		body()
}

func $while { test, body |
	while test()
		body()
}

This probably can't be decided well for casting until the type system is further developed.

cast ::=
	expression value
	expression type

downcast ::=
	expression value
	expression type

rootcast ::=
	expression value

func $cast { val, type | val as type }
func $downcast { val, type | val downas type }
func $rootcast { val | rootcast val }

Criteria for determining whether a feature should get a node or just be included in the library.

--- action

Features that don't "do" anything should be in the library. Nodes should perform actions.

Examples:
	built-in interfaces
	built-in types
	reference to null ("null" keyword or "null" scidentre)
	constructors for collections

Counter examples: dictionary node

--- ability to implement

Strive for library features to be implementable using only nodes. (Avoid "magic" functions.) Strive for nodes to generally not be easily implementable using other nodes. (Avoid redundant features.)

Examples: each, map, filter

Counter examples: root_cast, redundancy of loop-iterator node and each function

--- ease of implementation

When either of a library addition or node would be easier to implement than the other, strive to go for the easier one.

--- easy to explain and understand

When one option is much more difficult to explain and understand than the other, go for the easier one.

--- complication

When one of a library addition or node would be very complicated, while the other would be much simpler, strive for the simpler one.

Simplicity also usually leads to it being easier to explain and understand. See above.

Example: generator node

Counter example: generator function

--- power

If one option is significantly more powerful than the other, go for the more powerful option.

Exception: When the function version is the more powerful version, but the function version is much harder to understand, and it could easily be defined in terms of a node. For example, generators.

--- precedence

If the feature is usually a statement/expression in other languages, strive to give it a node in Niviok. If the feature is usually a function in other languages, strive to make it a function in Niviok.

Examples: if-else node, each function

--- normality

If one option would be much weirder than the other, and it breaks lots of expectations, go for the more normal one.

Examples: generator node creating "yield" wo-scidentre vs. generator function passing in argument

--- default to node and function wrapper

If otherwise unable to decide, create a node and a function to wrap the node.

Examples: conditional node and ifelse function, generator node and make_generator function, loop-iterable and each function
