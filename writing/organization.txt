bundle
	imports
	planes

A bundle could be an executable program, but it doesn't have to be. It may just be a library. A bundle can both be executable and act as a library.

Planes contain declaration-pervasives. Each declaration-pervasive is visible to either only that plane, all planes within that bundle, or (if exported) visible to other bundles.


----- Desible assembly

<bundle>
	<import/>
	<import/>
	...
	
	<inline-plane>
		<declaration-pervasive/>
		<declaration-pervasive/>
		...
	</inline-plane>
	
	<plane-reference>
		<type>desible file</type>
		<path>foo.desible</path>
	</plane-reference>
	
	<plane-reference>
		<type>dextr file</type>
		<path>foo.dextr</path>
	</plane-reference>
</bundle>


----- Desible plane

<plane>
	<declaration-pervasive/>
	<declaration-pervasive/>
	...
</plane>


----- Dextr assembly

#standalone

import ...
import ...

func main()
	...

func doStuff()
	...


----- Dextr plane

func main()
	...

func doStuff()
	...


A compiler/interpreter could also take on the command line
	* paths to files representing planes
	* references to libraries
and construct the bundle node itself from this. This would make the interface to a Desal compiler very similar to the compilers of other languages.
