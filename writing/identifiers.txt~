An identifier is a sequence of words, with an optional ending exclamation mark or question mark.
A word is a sequence of Unicode characters, where each Unicode character is a letter or an Arabic numerical digit.
A letter is a member of an alphabet, abjad, abugida, syllabary, or logogram.
(letters are case sensitive wherever Unicode defines an uppercase and lowercase character for the same letter)
This specification does not specify all characters that do or do not qualify as letters, but it does list some characters that must be recognized a certain way.
letters: a-z, A-Z
not letters: `~!@#$%^&*(){}[]/=?+0-9_
Non-normative: This means a word is a sequence of Unicode characters, where each Unicode character is meaningful and is not a control character, punctation, or some other "weird" symbol. Basically, "name characters". If a character would be in somebody's name, it can be part of a word.
An Arabic numerical digit is from 0 to 9.
