Purpose: Determine a terse and general way of inserting elements into a collection.

Example C# code:
	List<Person> people = new List<Person> {
		new Person { FirstName = "Scott", LastName = "Guthrie", Age = 32 },
		new Person { FirstName = "Bill", LastName = "Gates", Age = 50 },
		new Person { FirstName = "Susanne", LastName = "Guthrie", Age = 32 }
	};

Note that the only constructor that Person has is an empty constructor, so properties each have to be assigned individually.


--- call-to-interface when declare

In Dextr:

decl Foo foo(...)

gets translated to:

decl Foo foo = Foo(...)

This of course only works when Foo can be called to produce an object of type Foo, such as if Foo was created by a class node.


---- with node

with ::= {
	expression target
	expression body
}
Properties of [target] are the only in-scope identikeys besides "outer" namespace. Produces [target].


--- let pseudo node

The "let" pseudo node is just Dextr syntax that gets translated to a block and declaration-assign nodes.

Example:
	let a = 123, b = a * 2, c = getFoo() {
		doStuff( a, b, c )
	}
	
	block {
		decl a = 123
		decl b = a * 2
		decl c = getFoo()
		block {
			doStuff( a, b, c )
		}
	}


--- examples

//uses with node
decl Set<Person> people()
each( people.insert!, [
	with Person() : FirstName = "Scott", LastName = "Guthrie", Age = 32,
	with Person() : FirstName = "Bill", LastName = "Gates", Age = 50,
	with Person() : FirstName = "Susanne", LastName = "Guthrie", Age = 32 ])

//uses let node
decl Set<Person> people()
each( |x,y,z| { people << (let o = Person() : o.FirstName=x, o.LastName=y, o.Age=z, o) }.apply, [
	[ "Scott", "Guthrie", 32 ],
	[ "Bill", "Gates", 50 ],
	[ "Susanne", "Guthrie", 32 ] ])

//uses let node and bind-by-type operator
decl Set<Person> people()
|x,y,z| { let o = Person() : o.FirstName=x, o.LastName=y, o.Age=z, o }.apply ->
map([
	[ "Scott", "Guthrie", 32 ],
	[ "Bill", "Gates", 50 ],
	[ "Susanne", "Guthrie", 32 ]
]) -> each( people.insert! )


--- ideal

If Set has a constructor that took a collection, and Person had a constructor that took the names and age.

decl Set<Person> people( map( Person.apply, [
	[ "Scott", "Guthrie", 32 ],
	[ "Bill", "Gates", 50 ],
	[ "Susanne", "Guthrie", 32 ] ]))

decl Set<Person> people(
	map(
		Person.apply,
		[
			[ "Scott", "Guthrie", 32 ],
			[ "Bill", "Gates", 50 ],
			[ "Susanne", "Guthrie", 32 ]
		]
	)
)
