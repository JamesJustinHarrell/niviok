scope
	can have child scopes; can be a parent to a scope
	Scope b = new Scope(a); #okay!

	does not have child scopes; can be a parent to a scope
	Scope b = new Scope(a); #wrong!

Executing a module should not produce a scope, because the thing that module produces should not be capable of being a parent to a scope.
