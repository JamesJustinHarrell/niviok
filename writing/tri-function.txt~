For many actions, there are three functions I want:

* can_do_stuff?
	Tells whether the action can be performed successfully.

* do_stuff
	Performs the action. Throws an error if the action could not be performed.

* try_do_stuff
	Tries to perform the action. If do_stuff doesn't return anything, returns a Bool indicating whether the action was successfully performed. If do_stuff returns something (non-nullable), returns a nullable version of that. If do_stuff returns something nullable, a try_do_stuff function might not be possible.

The try function can be made from the performing function, but the can? function cannot, since the performing function may have side effects.

examples:
	can_cast?, cast, try_cast
	Scope.hasIdentikey, Scope.evaluateIdentifier, Scope.tryEvaluateIdentifier

It would be great if Niviok could somehow help here.
