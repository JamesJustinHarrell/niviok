			<title>Basic</title>
			
			<para>Desal is a collection of abstract nodes. Nodes that can be "executed" are called "expressions". (Desal does not make use of the terms "statement", "evaluate", or "evaluation".) Some expressions "produce" a value when executed, and others do not.</para>
			
			<para>How Desal nodes are represented is outside the scope of this standard. Syntax and semantics are intended to be entirely separate.</para>
			
			<para>Desal contains some dynamic aspects, but in several ways is very static. For example, the tree of scopes ("environments" in some languages) and variables/constants ("identikeys" in Desal) can be entirely known before runtime; identikeys cannot be declared conditionally like in highly dynamic languages such as JavaScript.</para>
		</section>
		
		<section xml:id="specification-version">
			<title>Version</title>
			
			<para>Each version of Desal Semantics has a major version number and a minor version number, both integers incrementing by one. When the major version number is incremented, the minor version number is reset to 0.</para>
			
			<para>All versions of Desal Semantics should be backwards compatible with previous versions that have the same major version number. That means the major version number should be changed when changes are made that break backwards compatibility.</para>
			
			<para>Example: Something that is valid Desal Semantics 5.3 will also be valid Desal Semantics 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, etc.</para>
			
			<para>Each specification describing a version of Desal Semantics may have multiple editions, each represented by an integer that's incremented by one. The first finalized specification for a version of Desal Semantics is the first edition, or edition one. Creating a new edition is a revision. Revisions should serve to clarify, add guidance, and correct errors in the specification, not to add or remove functionality. Revisions should not attempt to correct errors in Desal Semantics, only errors in describing Desal Semantics. Implementations should target the latest finalized edition of the version they are targeting.</para>
			
			<para>Each edition may have multiple drafts before being finalized. Each draft is represented by a date around the time it was published. Implementations and specifications should not target drafts.</para>
			
			<para>A version of Desal Semantics may be represented as "Desal Semantics X.Y" where X is the major version number and Y is the minor version number. A finalized specification for Desal Semantics may be represented as "Desal Semantics X.Y Edition A" where A is the edition number. A draft of a specification may be represented as "Desal Semantics X.Y Edition A Draft B" where B is the date in YYYYMMDD format.</para>
			
			<para>This specification describes Desal Semantics 1.0. This specification has never been finalized, so is working towards the first edition. It is still in the draft stages.</para>
			
			<para>When this specification is finalized, it will be Edition 1 (instead of Edition 1 Draft YYYYMMDD). If the finalized specification is revised, the next finalized edition will be Edition 2.</para>

			<title>Scope</title>
			
			<para>This document defines Desal semantics, but not how to represent them.</para>
		</section>
		
		<section xml:id="compliance">
			<title>Compliance</title>
			
			<para>This specification provides a definition of compliance. Other definitions of compliance may exist outside of this specification, but to be compliant as defined by this specification, these requirements must be met.</para>
			
			<para>For an implementation to be "base compliant", it must meet all the "must" requirements listed in this spec. If this spec says an implementation "must" do something, the implementation will not be considered base compliant according to this specification if it does not do it.</para>
			
			<para>Above base compliance, there are further levels of compliance. Each correct implementation of a "should" requirement increases the compliance level, and each failure to implement a "should" requirement decreases the compliance level. Two different compliance levels can only be compared if one is a subset of the other.</para>
			
			<para>For example, consider an implementation Alpha that meets all the "must" requirements and three of the the "should" requirements, and an implementation Beta that meets all the "must" requirements and five of the "should" requirements. If Beta does not meet the three "should" requirements that Alpha meets, Aplha is not a subset of Beta, so it cannot be said that Beta is more compliant than Alpha. But if Beta meets the same three "should" requirements as Alpha (in addition to the other two), then Alpha is a subset of Beta, so it can be said that Beta is more compliant than Alpha.</para>
			
			<para>This specification also has "encourgements". These encouragements are considered good ideas by the specficiation author(s), but may not always be appropriate or may not be necessary for interoperability. Complying with these encouragements does not increase an implementation's compliance.</para>

		<para>Desal semantics are represented by a node tree. The way this node tree is represented is not covered in this specification. This specification explains what kind of node tree a representation can represent, the meaning of the nodes in a Desal node tree, and how to execute the node tree.</para>
		
		<para>This node tree has scopes attached at various places. These scopes contain identikeys that are bound to namespaces and values.</para>
		
		<section xml:id="identikeys">
			<title>identikeys</title>
			
			<para>An identikey is associated with a scope, an identifier, and zero or more values. An identikey may place restrictions on what values in can be associated with. It may be mutable so that what values it is associated with can change, or immutable so that in cannot be reassociated with different values.</para>

			<para>Every scope is assocciated with zero or more identikeys. Identikeys associated with the same scope must each be associated with a different identifier.</para>

			<para>When an identifier node is executed, every identikey in the scope the identifier node resides in is checked to see if the identikey is associated with an equivalent identifier. If it is, the value produce by executing the identifier node is obtained from the identikey. The identifier node execution process moves up through the scope tree (not to be confused with the scope formula tree) looking for an identikey associated with an equivalent identifier.</para>

			<para>Dynamic identikeys are always variable.</para>
			
			<para>A function identikey can be bound to multiple functions (objects that implement a function interface; xxx link) at the same time. A function identikey can never be bound to multiple functions with the same interface.</para>
			
			<para>If the value does not implement the interface of the identifier, a cast error results (doesn't apply to dyn).</para>
			
			<para>If a value has multiple callees, the active interface is not a function interface, and thus it cannot be bound to a function identikey. The value must be cast to each function interface, and each resulting value bound individually to the function identikey.</para>

			<para>Overloading an identifier means binding multiple object references to it.</para>

			<para>Const identikeys can never be unbound from what they're bound to. Function, strict, and automatic identikeys can be const.</para>

			<title>Built-in numbers</title>
			
			<para>The built-in implementations of the Int and Rat interfaces must be able to handle numbers of an arbitrary complexity. Built-in libraries should handle numbers of an arbitrary complexity. Desal implementations must not ever introduce rounding errors or otherwise introduce numerical errors without being explicitly told that such errors may occur.</para>
			
			<para>For example, pow(10, pow(10,100)), must correctly return an Int object reference that accurately represents a googolplex, and must be able to perform operations on this number with perfect accuracy.</para>
			
			<para>Implementations may throw errors when they are unable to perfectly represent a number. Implementations must not silently introduce errors. This is the only alternative to perfectly representing the number.</para>
			
			<para>For example, if the implementation was directed by user code to print a googolplex without using scientific notation (i.e. a "1" followed by a googol "0"), the implementation may throw an error specifying that it is unable to create such a representation.</para>

		<para>Objects hold which is used by the interface implementation. This state can only be accessed or modified by interface implementations that they object was intented to hold state for. Objects have an ID that never changes. Each interface implementation consists of the implementation of the members of that interface.</para>
		
		<para>This specification may speak of values implementing interfaces. In these cases, what is actually refered to is whether the interface implementation the value is associtiated with is in a tree where one of the interface implementations is an implementation of that interface. The value itself does not actually implement any interfaces.</para>
		
		<para>Interface implementations form a tree. Multiple interface implementations in the same tree can implement the same iterface. When a value has an active interface that has multiple implementations, the interface implementation that is used when the value is accessed is the interface implementation that the vaule is associated with.</para>

		<para>Interfaces define a means of interacting with an object's state. Interfaces declare that implementations will be able to provide object references with specified interfaces when asked for the object reference bound to identifiers specified by the interface and/or that implementations will be able to bind object references with specified interfaces to specified identifiers. Methods are a type of property. Methods are callable and cannot be assigned, only retrieved.</para>
		
		<para>Interfaces can declare that properties are "get only", "set only", or "get and set".</para>
		
		<para>Interface member functions can have default values. This differs from a class with abstract members because interfaces cannot have any private members, so these default functions can not store or extract state in the object. These functions are only intended to call other member functions or throw errors.</para>
		
		<para>There are two kinds of interfaces: object interfaces (Interface) and function interfaces (FuncInterface). Object interfaces define properties and methods. Function interfaces define parameters and a return type. An interface cannot be a function interface and an object interface, though an object interface can have call methods that allow implementations to be used like functions. A function interface can be wrapped to an object interface with a single call method.</para>
		
		<para>Interface callees and members may refer to the interface. This is useful when an interface wants to define a method that returns an object reference with itself as the active interface. For generic interfaces, it is also possible to refer to the generic template.</para>

		<para>Scopes consist of a collection of identikeys, and unless it is the scope of the bundle node, an association with a parent scope. Scopes form a hierarchy. When identifier nodes are executed, the current scope is searched for an identikey that is associated with that identifier. If one is not found, that scope's parent scope is searched, and so on, until a matching identikey is found. If such an identikey cannot be found, an error results.</para>

		<para>Desal semantics are represented by a tree of nodes. How this tree and its nodes are represented is outside the scope of this specification. Many means may exist of representing a Desal tree.</para>

		<para>Nodes are either base nodes or tree nodes. Tree nodes only contain other nodes, and their entire meaning is derived from their child nodes. Base nodes do not contain any other child nodes, and must is some way encode their meaning themselves.</para>
		
		<para>When a node has multiple child nodes with equivalent meaning, the order of those child nodes is significant, so their order must be specified by some means. The order of nodes of different meaning in relation to each other is not significant, and must not have any observable side effects.</para>
		
		<para>The child nodes of tree nodes are sometimes executed in order, such as expressions in blocks and arguments in function calls. This means the order of the child nodes is sometimes significant and thus should always be preserved.</para>

However, the mutator methods may throw a PrecisionError if the value is not capable of representing the resultant integer.</para>
			
			<para>When Desal implementations need to determine the value of Int objects that were implemented by user code, they should call the toBuiltin method to get an Int object that was implemented by the implementation. If toBuiltin throws an error, it should raise into user code. If the returned Int is not a built-in, an error results that should extend into user code.</para>
			
			<para>The String produced by the String convertee must represent the stored integer absolutely, with no loss of precision. It may throw an error if it is incapable of producing such a representation. There are no restrictions on how the integer should be represented, although Int implementations generally should try to produce a representation that is simple and short. Implementations of Int should prefer exotic and strange representations over throwing an error. For example, implementations should prefer representing a googolplex with e.g. "10E(10E100)" ofer throwing an error.</para>

		<title>Rationales</title>
		
		<para>This chapter explains the decisions behind various choices made for Desal.</para>
		
		<section xml:id="rationale.dynamic-static-typing">
			<title>Dynamic static typing</title>
			
			<para>Dynamic static typing refers to explicitly using and enforcing type information that isn't available until runtime. The type information isn't known until runtime, but after it's known, it's enforced and can't be changed.</para>
			
			<para>An example of this is loading an interface from a library and then using obtaining values with that interface through the library. The loaded interface can be used as the type for function parameters, free identifiers, etc. So although the interface wasn't known until runtime, one the information was known, it was enforced, and the values of that interface are only accessed by ensuring they are of that interface.</para>
			
			<para>Dynamic static typing can do nothing beforehand to ensure property/method access is correct, but it can ensure that various values are of the same type. For example, consider the case where an interface is loaded from a library and bound to an identifer. Then a free identifier is declared to be of that type, and a function is declared to accept a value of that type. An implementation will known that the free identifer and the function's parameter are of the same type, so the value bound to the free identifier can safely be passed to the function. This safety could not be ensured with fully dynamic typing.</para>
			
			<para>Dynamic static typing is not as safe as fully static typing, but interfaces cannot always be known before runtime, which is a requirement for fully static typing. Therefore, Desal should provide something to give more type safety for the cases when interfaces cannot be known until runtime. Dynamic static typing is safer than fully dynamic typing.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
Interface Foo = lib['Foo']
Interface Bar = lib['Bar']
func()Foo getFoo = lib['getFoo']
func(Bar)Int doStuff = lib['doStuff']

Foo foo = getFoo() //static typing: known beforehand that types match
foo.somthing() //dynamic typing: don't know beforehand whether Foo declares a 'somthing' method
doStuff(foo) //static typing: known beforehand that types don't match

---

Dyn getFoo = lib['getFoo']
Dyn doStuff = lib['doStuff']

Dyn foo = getFoo() //dynamic typing: don't know beforehand whether types match
foo.somthing() //dynamic typing: don't know beforehand whether value of foo has a "somthing" method
doStuff(foo) //dynamic typing: don't know beforehand whether types match
			</programlisting>
			
			<para>Arguments against: Interfaces should almost always be known beforehand. Dynamic static typing may be very rarely used, and could encourage bad programming.</para>
