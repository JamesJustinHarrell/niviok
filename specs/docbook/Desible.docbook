			<title>text nodes escaping</title>
			
			<para>Elements that contain only text have an implied attribute "escaped" which defaults to "false". The other possible option is "true". The value is not inherited by child elements. If the @escaped attribute appears on elements that do not directly contain text nodes, agents should warn that it has no effect.</para>
			
			<para>If escaping is enabled, \000000 (6 hexadecimal digits) should be interpreted as a Unicode code point, and \\ should be interpreted as a backslash. If an agent encounters a \ that isn't followed by either 6 hex digits or another \ in a text node with escaping on, the agent should stop and output an error message.</para>
