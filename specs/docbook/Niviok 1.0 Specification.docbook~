		<para>This document is a draft of the first edition of the specification describing the 1.0 version of Niviok.</para>
		
		<para>Niviok is an abstract programming language. This document defines several node types which are used to represent Niviok source code. How Niviok nodes are represented is outside the scope of this standard. While syntax and semantics are not completetly separate, Niviok does contain much less syntax-influenced semantics than most programming languages.</para>
		
		<para>Nodes that can be executed are statements or expressions. Statements are greatly restricted in where they can appear, while expressions are more relaxed and can be interchanged for on another. An expression may produce a value when executed.</para>

		<para>Niviok contains some dynamic aspects, but in several ways is very static. For example, the tree of ##scopes and ##scidentres can be entirely known before runtime; scidentres cannot be declared conditionally like in highly dynamic languages such as JavaScript.</para>

All other nodes must only be executed when required by the execution instructions of another node, or as required to call a callee/method (such as when calling a value created by a function node).

All Niviok nodes that are executed in any way must be part of a complete Niviok node tree, which means having an bundle node as the root node.</para>

			<para>The built-in implementations of the Int and Rat interfaces must be able to handle numbers of an arbitrary complexity. Built-in libraries should handle numbers of an arbitrary complexity. Niviok implementations must not ever introduce rounding errors or otherwise introduce numerical errors without being explicitly told that such errors may occur.</para>
			
			<para>For example, pow(10, pow(10,100)), must correctly return an Int object reference that accurately represents a googolplex, and must be able to perform operations on this number with perfect accuracy.</para>
			
			<para>Implementations may throw errors when they are unable to perfectly represent a number. Implementations must not silently introduce errors. This is the only alternative to perfectly representing the number.</para>
			
			<para>For example, if the implementation was directed by user code to print a googolplex without using scientific notation (i.e. a "1" followed by a googol "0"), the implementation may throw an error specifying that it is unable to create such a representation.</para>

		<title>Values</title>
		
		<para>Values are associated with an object and an interface implementation.</para>
		
		<para>Objects hold which is used by the interface implementation. This state can only be accessed or modified by interface implementations that they object was intented to hold state for. Objects have an ID that never changes. Each interface implementation consists of the implementation of the members of that interface.</para>
		
		<para>This specification may speak of values implementing interfaces. In these cases, what is actually refered to is whether the interface implementation the value is associtiated with is in a tree where one of the interface implementations is an implementation of that interface. The value itself does not actually implement any interfaces.</para>
		
		<para>Interface implementations form a tree. Multiple interface implementations in the same tree can implement the same iterface. When a value has an active interface that has multiple implementations, the interface implementation that is used when the value is accessed is the interface implementation that the vaule is associated with.</para>

		<title>Interfaces</title>
		
		<para>Interfaces define a means of interacting with an object's state. Interfaces declare that implementations will be able to provide object references with specified interfaces when asked for the object reference bound to identifiers specified by the interface and/or that implementations will be able to bind object references with specified interfaces to specified identifiers. Methods are a type of property. Methods are callable and cannot be assigned, only retrieved.</para>
		
		<para>Interfaces cannot inherit in a circle. (E.g., interface A cannot inherit interface B if interface B inherits interface A.) Interfaces cannot inherit from themselves. (However, interfaces created by instantiating values created from generic-interface nodes should not throw errors if the interface tries to inherit itself. Instead, the error should be silently ignored. This is to allow generic interfaces to inherit other forms of themselves.) Interfaces that do not explicitly inherit any interfaces, should implicitly inherit Object. Therefore, all interfaces inherit from Object, either directly or indirectly.</para>
		
		<para>Interfaces can declare that properties are "get only", "set only", or "get and set".</para>
		
		<para>Interface member functions can have default values. This differs from a class with abstract members because interfaces cannot have any private members, so these default functions can not store or extract state in the object. These functions are only intended to call other member functions or throw errors.</para>
		
		<para>There are two kinds of interfaces: object interfaces (Interface) and function interfaces (FuncInterface). Object interfaces define properties and methods. Function interfaces define parameters and a return type. An interface cannot be a function interface and an object interface, though an object interface can have call methods that allow implementations to be used like functions. A function interface can be wrapped to an object interface with a single call method.</para>
		
		<para>Interface callees and members may refer to the interface. This is useful when an interface wants to define a method that returns an object reference with itself as the active interface. For generic interfaces, it is also possible to refer to the generic template.</para>

	<para>Concerning the last example: When one of these functions is called, infinite recursion occurs (negating intervention by the agent), but no such cycle is involved in just executing the function nodes.

		<para>This chapter explains the decisions behind various choices made for Niviok.</para>
		
		<section xml:id="rationale.dynamic-static-typing">
			<title>Dynamic static typing</title>
			
			<para>Dynamic static typing refers to explicitly using and enforcing type information that isn't available until runtime. The type information isn't known until runtime, but after it's known, it's enforced and can't be changed.</para>
			
			<para>An example of this is loading an interface from a library and then using obtaining values with that interface through the library. The loaded interface can be used as the type for function parameters, free identifiers, etc. So although the interface wasn't known until runtime, one the information was known, it was enforced, and the values of that interface are only accessed by ensuring they are of that interface.</para>
			
			<para>Dynamic static typing can do nothing beforehand to ensure property/method access is correct, but it can ensure that various values are of the same type. For example, consider the case where an interface is loaded from a library and bound to an identifer. Then a free identifier is declared to be of that type, and a function is declared to accept a value of that type. An implementation will known that the free identifer and the function's parameter are of the same type, so the value bound to the free identifier can safely be passed to the function. This safety could not be ensured with fully dynamic typing.</para>
			
			<para>Dynamic static typing is not as safe as fully static typing, but interfaces cannot always be known before runtime, which is a requirement for fully static typing. Therefore, Niviok should provide something to give more type safety for the cases when interfaces cannot be known until runtime. Dynamic static typing is safer than fully dynamic typing.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
Interface Foo = lib['Foo']
Interface Bar = lib['Bar']
func()Foo getFoo = lib['getFoo']
func(Bar)Int doStuff = lib['doStuff']

Foo foo = getFoo() //static typing: known beforehand that types match
foo.somthing() //dynamic typing: don't know beforehand whether Foo declares a 'somthing' method
doStuff(foo) //static typing: known beforehand that types don't match

---

Dyn getFoo = lib['getFoo']
Dyn doStuff = lib['doStuff']

Dyn foo = getFoo() //dynamic typing: don't know beforehand whether types match
foo.somthing() //dynamic typing: don't know beforehand whether value of foo has a "somthing" method
doStuff(foo) //dynamic typing: don't know beforehand whether types match
			</programlisting>
			
			<para>Arguments against: Interfaces should almost always be known beforehand. Dynamic static typing may be very rarely used, and could encourage bad programming.</para>

			<title>Disallowing executing declaration-first</title>
			
			<para>Children of declaration-first nodes are executed when the scope is first created, which may involve executing an identifier associated with a variable identikey. When execution reaches a declaration-first node, the identifiers used to create the initial value assigned to the identikey may be assigned to different values. Thus, executing a declaration-first node could produce unexpected results.</para>

			<para>In the above example, alpha is executed and assigned to beta when the scope for the block node is created. Then, 9000 is assigned to alpha. Then, the declaration-first node is executed, producing the value assigned to beta, which is 12345.
