PROBLEM:

reference-category
reference-type
identifier-category
identifier-type

Where does FUNCTION fit into this?

Are there function references, where a single reference is bound to multiple callable values, or does a reference only refer to one value? That would require that a function identifier be associated with multiple references.

Problem: Identifiers are only supposed to be associated with one reference.

Problem: A reference should be able to evaluate to a value and the type of that value is the same as the reference.

Perhaps there's just some mixing of reference and value.
